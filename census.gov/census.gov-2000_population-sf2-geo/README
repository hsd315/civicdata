This source package will download the files for the 2000 US Census, summary file 1, 
and create a partitioned bundle. 

This bundle is very large, and will require 250GB to build. 

The headers and table definitions can be obtained from an Access97 fle 
provided by the Census.gov:  

	http://www.census.gov/support/2000/SF1/Access97.zip


Use mdb-tools to extract schema and data from this file, including 
information about tables and columns. 

These files result from extraction from the SF1.MDB file, which comes from the
Access97 zip archive:
    meta/columns.csv
    meta/tables.sql
    
meta/sf1geo.sql is extracted from the meta/tables.sql file. 


meta/geoheaders comes from the IRE Census project, 
https://raw.github.com/ireapps/census/master/dataprocessing/census2000_geo_schema.csv

DATA CHANGES
------------

The geo file for Puerto Rico has a lot of b-bit names. Census files are encoded 
as IBM850, and these encoding are converted to unicode. In general, this conversion 
happened whenever sqlite throws an error when an 8-bit string is inserted.
