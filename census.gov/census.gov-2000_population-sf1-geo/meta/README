Notes

Got rid of the Consolodated city geo table, since there only a few valid values,
from the SF! documentation, 7-9:

03436 Athens-Clarke County, Georgia
04200 Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia
11397 Butte-Silver Bow, Montana
19000 Columbus, Georgia
36003 Indianapolis, Indiana
47515 Milford, Connecticut
52006 Nashville-Davidson, Tennessee

These regions should be distinguishable, and avoidable, by their sumlev
