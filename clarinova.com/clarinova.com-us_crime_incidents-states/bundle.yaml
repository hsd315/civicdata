    title: US Crime Incidents, 2007 to 2010
    description: >
      San Diego Crime incidents from 2007 to 2010. These files 
      include the date, category, location and description of crime incidents 
      that were scraped from public websites by SpotCrime.com, 
      which makes the data available under this disclaimer. Because these 
      records were scraped from a website with a
      program that we don't have access to, the data should be 
      considered illustrative, not definitive. Don't use this data 
      for statistical analysis without understanding its limitations.
