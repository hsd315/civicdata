CMS's SSA to FIPS CBSA and MSA County Crosswalk
================================================

CMS.gov ( Which administers Medicare ) produces crosswalk files that connects old and new 
MSA codes and CBSA to MSA. These connections are ver valuable for working with multiple census files. 

NBER has a page that collects and describes the crosswalk files: 

	http://www.nber.org/data/cbsa-msa-fips-ssa-county-crosswalk.html
	
The README for the directory lists the URLs to the CMS files:

We are also processing a file from 2005, but it has different columns, and is 
only available in Excel format, so we converted it to CSV. The original file is:

FY_05: http://data.nber.org/cbsa-msa-fips-ssa-county-crosswalk/2005/fr05_cbsa_msa_xwalk_pub.zip

The converted file is:
